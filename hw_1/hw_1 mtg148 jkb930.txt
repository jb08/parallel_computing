EECS 358 Homework 1

1. 
a) O(n*(2m-1)) ; each row takes m multiplications and (m-1) additions; n rows
b) O(2nm/p + m) ; 2 operations per inner loop, m inner loops, n outer loops, plus final summation that takes m operations (doesn’t count assignment as an operation)
c) Sp = Ts / Tp = (n(2m-1) / (2nm/p + m))
   Amdahl’s fraction 
   [read and re-group]

2. (what do the -o and -lpthread mean?)

a) logged in
